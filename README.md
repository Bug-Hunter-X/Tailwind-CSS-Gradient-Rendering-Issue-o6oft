# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Tailwind CSS gradients: inconsistent rendering across different browsers and configurations.

## Problem

The provided Tailwind CSS code snippet uses gradient classes (`bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500`) to create a background gradient. However, in some environments, this gradient may not render as expected, or might be missing entirely. This can be caused by several factors, including browser inconsistencies, CSS conflicts, or incorrect configuration.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring proper Tailwind CSS setup and potentially using fallback mechanisms to ensure consistent rendering. The solution file contains the corrected and improved code.
